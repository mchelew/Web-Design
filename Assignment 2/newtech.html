    <h2>LaunchCoderGirl</h2>
    
    <p>Coder Girl started when Colleen Liebig, a portfolio success manager with St. Louis-based Cultivation Capital, had trouble getting through the initial EdX.org Computer Science 50 course, which LaunchCode centered its twice-weekly meetups around earlier this year.
Liebig began reaching out to other women who may have had interest in taking the online course with her again. She wound up getting 500 interested women, which got the attention of LaunchCode officials, who are now partnering with Liebig to help support the group of women set to take the CS50 course.

“LaunchCode stepped in with a partnership and basically it’s going to be their Coder Girl division,” Liebig said.
Brendan Lind, managing director for LaunchCode, said Coder Girl, which could transform into LaunchCoderGirl in the near future as the partnership grows, is essentially the next iteration of LaunchCode.
Coder Girl’s first event will be held tonight at the James S. McDonnell Planetarium beginning at 5:30 p.m. The first event will be an information session with guest speakers including LaunchCode founder Jim McKelvey and St. Louis Science Center CEO Bert Vescolani.
To date, LaunchCode has placed more than 60 coders with experienced programmers inside companies across St. Louis, Lind said. About 30 of those aspiring coders have landed full-time gigs shortly thereafter.

Coder Girl could quickly gain traction beyond St. Louis if LaunchCode comes through with its expansion plans.
McKelvey said the company is eying a national expansion into places including Miami, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Denver and a location somewhere on the West Coast. LaunchCode would use its partnership with EdX, the online learning platform founded by Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to spur that expansion.
EdX CEO Anant Agarwal said he envisions a future partnership in which EdX could help recruit companies, lobby government agencies and spread the word to a larger student base. http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/blog/biznext/2014/04/edx-ceo-launchcode-s-st-louis-experiment-a-wild.html?page=all The LaunchCode model, Agarwal said, works particularly well with computer science and coding courses. Those students don’t typically have a traditional background or resume, he said.</p>
