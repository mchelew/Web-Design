        <p> Trees grow however makes them happy. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have 					to let it fall where it will. You're meant to have fun in life.

Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. The least little bit can do so much. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do.

Trees cover up a multitude of sins. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. In your world you have total and absolute power. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it.</p>
